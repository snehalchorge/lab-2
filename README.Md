In this we first downloaded and installed vagrant on our local device and after that we downloaded the vagrant box. After that we made changes in the Vagrantfile to install the apache in the VM and then we viewed the installed apache service in our browser by entering the IP from the Vagrantfile into our browser. Then we made multiple machines. Then we pushed the Vagrantfile on to github. Then we created a repository on the github. After that we brought the Vagrantfile on the staging area by using vagrant add command, then we committed and then pushed the file on github. We then were able to view the file on github.
